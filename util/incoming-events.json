The event featured Mutt Taylor's \"One-Man Mexican Standoff\" and Amy Sleeverson's \"Ponderosa Wives\" (cutting boards for sale with holes in them). The event was potentially most notable for its no-shows: Russel Shein turned away at the sign outside of the dunk tank that read \"Dunk Russel Shein in a Dunk Tank Full of Piss\"; Mano Agapion; Bartleby Mulcahey forgot; Chip Junction was disallowed by his grandmother; and Cram Daniels was busy with a live YouTube podcast event of his own. The event was more likely most notable, however, for the \"thousands upon thousands of Invisible Mans\" that attended. Furious, Mr. Wilcox began shooting and stabbing these guests \"indiscriminantly\" and eventually was forced to just \"press the self-destruct button\" (detonate explosives) on the ranch itself."
