She therefore set out to incorporate *herself* as the WFMH. Wearing a powdered wig and a big sack she purchased with Sea Org funds, she announced herself grandly to The Incorporation Offices, where she was met with a request for proof of identity. Aboard the Sea Org flagship in approximately 1970, Ms. Corporate was considering a third character to present to Incorporation officers. At that same time, Ms. Corporate changed her name to 'Tomato Loose Pie' and then shortly thereafter to simply 'Loose Pie.' She sleeps on a spindle of rope."

Following a bout with a comprimised sexual prowess that was repaired by testosterone injections and ritualistic group scenarios, his doctors recommended he expect a future characterized by 'dependency and sex magic.' Under nitrous oxide, later, he 'glimpsed the infinite' and was holistically repaired, from feet to spine to sexual performance. According to Hubbard, his prior lives include, but are not limited to: a Carthaginian sailor; a race car driver on Venus; inventor of the Magic Marker, Neil Sharpie; the 5th Hunchback of Notre Dame; a marshal to Joan of Arc; mayor of Pangea; a disgraced priest; and a contemporary of Machiaveli."

The tattoo made it difficult to position him anywhere else in the structure but was no less honorific. He claims to have the 'sun tolerance of a tribesman and the intellect of a white man.' He also suffers from Psoriasis. Some time around 2007-2008 he entered a voluntary coma to escape medical bills and harassment from his cousin/wife, Penny. In the prosthetic cabinet installed to fill his shark wound, Ahi now smuggles contraband across international land borders, a position that was laboriously secured for him by Penny."

He also occasionally encourages his students to stand on their desks and call him 'Captain.' Mr. Bongo wears a beautiful set of (fake) teeth which make him salivate and spit in the classes he teaches, making the experience 'a little slushy' for the front row. He lives in a tent on a speedboat in Marina del Rey. He's 'pretty good at tricking people out onto the water' via fake whale watching tours. He believes he may be the father of a number of children who look like him and are proficient at playing the bongos as well. He considers himself a drug survivor, a designation with which not everybody agrees except perhaps his doctor who has determined that Mr. Bongo is operating on only two of the four quadrants of his brain. In lieu of drugs, Mr. Bongo now practices a number of different approaches to achieving natural highs such as oxygen and sleep deprivation, squatting-and-standing-very-fast, and acid. He does parking lot security and cafeteria duty at MDRHS and doubles as a driver's ed instructor (despite being responsible for the most expensive car accident in the history of Marina del Rey). Mr. Bongo commands a musical combination called Rosebush Red. He does not own a watch and has openly admitted to flunking students in order to maintain a more stable lineup for that outfit. He gets into a lot of fights with charicaturists out on the Venice Fishing Pier and he hasn't purchased a single 'Guiness Book of World Records' since they stopped certifying and endorsing dangerous stunts. He claims to have 3 fathers (does not know which is his biological father) and he writes one sexually-explicit letter a day to Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. He has expressed dissatisfaction with the decreasing length of conjugal visits in the California state penal system. Mr. Bongo does not have a birthday and therefore marks time by counting the Olympics - by 2015 he had seen 18 long jump competitions, placing his age somewhere above 72. He is not an android and he's 'tired of the question.' Also he does own a rug made of human hair; has been 'brutally beaten on a number occasions' for not having his bongos with him; and believes himself to be the inspiration behind the character of Isaac on ABC's 'The Love Boat' because, for a while, he was a bartender on a cruise ship and despite him, at that time, not being an African-American."

As such, he was able to get a scoop on the potential baby names for the baby who would come to be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge. He owns a hat made by a 'true, authentic African' and, in 2013, at least, intended to impersonate a doctor and kidnap the royal child and sit on the throne of Australia. As of CBB#300 in July 2014, the former part of the plan at least appeared successful, however by CBB#564 in September of 2018 Mr. Denniston had already done a stint in HR Prison Wandsworth in London due to a misunderstanding with the guards at Kensington Palace. In Wandsworth, Mr. Denniston promoted himself to guard after the former guard drowned in a large pot of lukewarm soup, worked the remaining 3 hours of the shift, and then promptly escaped. Still, he has a remarkable success rate absconding with royal babies and interacting with them offsite before leaving them to be returned by passers-by. Daily he drinks one coffee and writes one letter to The Daily Mail. He is not a squirrel but he is stealthy and fleet of foot and therefore is able to share lunches with citizens in Hyde Park and, occasionally, steal their wallets. He also owns a collection of 'thousands upon thousands' of adult wigs, none of which fit a baby's head. He wears a vest full of small throwing knives and always carries a small bottle of Chloroform. He is possibly immortal, possibly a modern incarnation of the Wizard Merlin. Unproven. He has accidentally, from time to time, poisoned a baby with food."

He routinely files away Andi Callahan's fingerprints for him; he very likely was the 'Rapids Rapist' in rural Wisconsin; and everything he wears is made from a snake and he's terrific with kids. Tony left home at 11 years of age when 'shit went bad' and his parents asked him to leave. He didn't leave immediately, was then 'set-to with a hammer' while he read the funny papers and left. He was unable to return even had he wanted because his parents had told him he had a severe paper allergy and they had intentionally scrambled the address on his house. In his later years, overcoming the paper allergy, he every Christmas writes a letter to his aunt Eileen in 'China, USA.' He currently works at the ArcLight, giving hand jobs at the command of Don DiMello in return, usually, for popcorn as well as Jack Fitzgerald's backyard college, for which he serves as an admissions officer. Following his defenestration from the Earwolf studios, he was in rough shape, tooling around Los Angeles 'clearly brain-damaged' in 'a filthy wheelchair' made 'entirely out of snakeskin,' according to Gil, for whom he posed as a booking agent."

A majority of these games turned out to have been unwinnable. In 2011 Gardner launched a campaign to become the next Honorary Mayor of Hollywood. He is significantly younger than he looks 'for several reasons,' which includes certainly his face having been run over by a Jeep leading him to wear masks for a considerable run of his career including his stint hosting SIYCHTFHAH during which he wore a mask that constantly dripped blood. He lives in a home in the Hollywood Hills that operates not unlike a high security asylum and experimental operating room for captured transients and former contentants on the television game show 'Zap,' the former of whom he has been labotomizing and stitching together to become a vessel for Satan should he return to Earth. He has been known to captain vessels which host Murder Clubs in International Waters. He may have perished in a Murder Club and become a living vessel for Satan himself. Either way, an appearance on Comedy Bang! Bang! #300 revealed that subsequent plastic surgeries have left him looking like Vincent d'Onofrio's alien character from the film 'Men in Black.' Chip is also known as the Side-by-Side Gretchen and has been sued more than once by the Jim Morrison estate."

He is the author of 'You Must Buy Your Wife at Least as Much Jewelry as You Buy Your Horse (and Other Poems and Observations, Humorous and Otherwise, from a Life on the Range) by Dalton Wilcox' which, due to the incompetence of his publisher, is largely not available anywhere. His sequel to Buy Your Wife is called 'You Still Have to Buy Your Wife at Least as Much Jewelry as You Buy Your Horse (and Even More Poems and Additional Observations, Humorous and Otherwise, from a Life Still Being Lived on the Range) by Dalton Wilcox, Who Also Wrote the Last Book.' He has also authored such poems as 'The Lonesome Cowboy,' 'The Lonesome Cowboy 2018,' 'Theres Other Things a Cowboy Can Also Fuck,' 'I Have Been to Goddamned Europe,' and 'Ben Cartwright Buried Three Wives'. He is plagued by -- and a self-declared vanquisher of -- mummies, Frankensteins, creatures from The Black Lagoon, and vampires but is occasionally suspected of vampirism himself. He knows how to hollow-out a horse and put a girl in there. He keeps a stake of wood down his pantleg at all times and he lives in Manhattan in his college-aged girlfriend's NYU dorm. He has, he says, 'changed several people's names.' He is also, evidently, a pimp in both New York City and in International Waters. In 2014 it was revealed he had been training with Bill Carter for years in anticipation of an epic battle between good and evil and that he has a teak penis that he whittled himself after an incident involving a Land Virginie and a rattlesnake. He is on the record stating that, if asked by a prostitute with whom he intends to be amorous to take a shower or remove his clothes, he will mostly comply. If asked to 'wear a frilly hat' by a prostitue, however, he will seek the services of a different woman. He is a loyal customer of Alamo Rent A Car; has been to Scotland; has had a tail surgically attached at one point that was later removed. Finally, while he doesn't like to admit it, preferring instead to be perceived as a respectable author, he does keep a cadre of girls out on a boat in international waters."

He has witnessed the light disappear from the eyes of a human more than 500 times. Including animals the total is estimated (by Andi) to be more than 10,000. Twenty of those were penguins."

After moving to California he briefly wrote water skiing-themed spec scripts for TV sitcoms such as 'Alice.' He has owned and operated more than one haunted, themed bed and breakfast. He at one time considered surgical breast implants as a means to get backstage at Sha Na Na shows but eventually discounted the notion. His last will and testament requests he be turned into an *actual* hot dog upon death and he drives a classic 1986 Volvo. He sidelines at the Hertz desk at the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, but has great difficulty pushing the supplemental insurance. He sidelines at Manhattan Beach selling sunglasses. Also wherever you could arguably say his legs end - that's where his shorts begin. He used to own a classic car -- a 1988 Volvo -- but had to sell it. Despite, he regularly attends Classic Car Night at Big Bog's in Toluca Lake. In early 2014 it was implied but never proven that he had originally been booked on Comedy Bang! Bang! fraudulently by Cactus Tony. Also he claims he can strip a Triumph motorcycle down to its constituent pieces in about two and a half years and that he's the third man in history to have sexual intercourse on water skiis. Also he admitted on CBB400 that he has perhaps murdered 40-50 people, largely at the behest of known murderer Edward Solly."

He has been 'trying to get into heroin for years.' He sidelines as the night manager of ArcLight Cinemas in Los Angeles.
