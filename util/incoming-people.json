Formerly a member of the Croatian Special Forces whose hands are 'registered weapons when combined with a shovel,' and formerly both a prisoner and a prison guard, he is described at times as a 'gadfly' and a 'man about town' and 'unencumbered by a sense of right and wrong' and 'up for anything' and 'good at digging holes,' and 'the Poet Laureate of the Car Circuit,' he is a known cohort of Don DiMello and Andi Callahan. He routinely files away Andi Callahan's fingerprints for him; he very likely was the 'Rapids Rapist' in rural Wisconsin; and everything he wears is made from a snake and he's terrific with kids. Tony left home at 11 years of age when 'shit went bad' and his parents asked him to leave. He didn't leave immediately, was then 'set-to with a hammer' while he read the funny papers and left. He was unable to return even had he wanted because his parents had told him he had a severe paper allergy and they had intentionally scrambled the address on his house. In his later years, overcoming the paper allergy, he every Christmas writes a letter to his aunt Eileen in 'China, USA.' He currently works at the ArcLight, giving hand jobs at the command of Don DiMello in return, usually, for popcorn.",

He lives in a home in the Hollywood Hills that operates not unlike a high security asylum and experimental operating room for captured transients and former contentants on the television game show 'Zap,' the former of whom he has been labotomizing and stitching together to become a vessel for Satan should he return to earth.",

In 2011 he wrote a comedic memoir about his adventures as an RN, primarily featuring the crazy things said and done by his patients. He has witnessed the light disappear from the eyes of a human more than 500 times. Including animals the total is estimated (by Andi) to be more than 10,000. Twenty of those were penguins.",
