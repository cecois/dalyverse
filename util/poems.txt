##### A Dangerous Life
(dedicated to the memories of Winston Black, Carlisle Dunhill, Baxter Fields, Tom Sherwood, Lester Delwood, Wesley Norton)

the cowboy's life is full of danger
to risks to his life he is never a stranger
he knows there's a chance his horse may throw him
he lives in a fear that a storm may blow him

of all the ways a cowboy may meet his end
there are few against which he can defend
his rifle can't shoot the wind or the fire
it will not work against vampires who stalk the plains for cowboy blood and leave their prey dead in the mud

every shadow that moves in the night gives the cowboy vampire fright
vampires, vampires, vampires, vampires
with fangs as sharp as new barbed wire
they sneak up on cowboys - sit behind em on their horse
and ride that way for miles, of course

the cowboy, riding unawares until he feels icy fingers brushing his hairs
off of his neck to get a clean bite
and reduce his palor to a ghostly white
a vampire can look like anyone - getting killed by one would not be fun
a smart cowboy will carry a stake of wood
and bury it in the heart of anyone he thinks he should

some of these may turn out to be regular men
but better safe than sorry then


##### The Lonesome Cowboy

a cowboy is a lonesome man
there's none more lonesome in the land
he rides atop his only friend - his horse, a companion on whom he can depend
his woman may be miles behind him
sadness and desperation may find him

but a cowboy who's wise will turn to the earth to lend him solace and even mirth
the earth from which all beauty springs, such bounty forth she always brings
he'll dig a hole with cracked, scorched hands; pour in all the water that hole demands
until that hole is moist, just right - the earth'll never put up any kind of a fight

his cries of joy no one will hear
in case i am not being clear - i'm saying that cowboy is gonna fuck a hole in the ground
we all do it, that's what i have found
any cowboy that knows that lonesome hell can fashion a land virginie well
if a cowboy's seed worked like other seeds there'd be cowboys growing everywhere across the plains like weeds


##### A Visit to Pittick Mansion

a mansion - large, forbidding, old
in the summer it is hot; in the winter, probably cold
because of an outdated heating system and a lack of central air
but there's worse things, by far, that is probably hidden in there
a mansion like this, like i am describing
is just the perfect place for a ghost to be hiding

a ghost, a specter, a phaint, and a spirit
stop listening now if you're too scared to hear it
i went in there looking - knowing what i would find
to slaughter a ghost is what i had in mind
the entryway was fine; and so was the toilet
the kitchen door howled like a ghost (so someone ought to oil it)

i went room-to-room looking for signs of haunting
and there's a lot of rooms there so that job is pretty daunting
but i saw nothing strange, nothing scary or dramatic
until i decided it was time to check the attic
"the attic's off-limits," said a man in a red vest with a pin reading "volunteer" a-pinned onto his chest
"i know why you don't want me there," i said as i pulled my gun
cuz that's where you and the other ghosts live, work, and have fun

the attic! of course that's where the ghosts of pittick house dwell
and this, here, was a-one of em (just trust me, i can tell)
he said "what are you talking about? put that gun away." in fear
and well, sir, as per usual that was all i needed to hear
three silver bullets -- blam, blam, blam, blam -- okay, i guess it was four
and the ghost of pittick mansion doesn't live there anymore

so you feel free to visit there if you live here or you're touring
but honestly i would skip it - it's an old house, it's kind of boring
